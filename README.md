# Deep-Learning-Projects
A collection of deep learning projects covering computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting using TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.


This repository contains a set of deep learning projects developed for research, coursework, and personal experimentation. The projects demonstrate the application of neural networks to solve real-world problems in areas such as:

- **Computer Vision** (image classification, object detection, CNNs)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** (text classification, sentiment analysis, LSTMs, transformers)
- **Time Series Forecasting** (RNNs, GRUs, sequence prediction)
- **Generative Models** (autoencoders, GANs)

Each project includes:
- Well-documented code in Python
- Model architectures and training pipelines
- Evaluation metrics and results
- Jupyter notebooks or scripts for experimentation

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- PyTorch
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
